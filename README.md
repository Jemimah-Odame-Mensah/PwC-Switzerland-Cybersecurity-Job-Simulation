# Integrated Cyber Defense and Risk Management Simulation

This project showcases my work on the Integrated Cyber Defense and Risk Management simulation, part of PwC Switzerland's Cybersecurity Virtual Experience on Forage. The simulation placed me in the role of a cybersecurity consultant tasked with analyzing and improving the security defenses of Boldi AG, a Swiss-based chemical component supplier facing increasing cybersecurity threats.

## Project Overview

Boldi AG had neglected its cybersecurity practices, having conducted its last risk assessment in 2014. With only a small internal IT team and reliance on external consultants, they were ill-prepared for the sophisticated threats posed by modern ransomware attacks. Following a competitor’s attack, Boldi AG urgently required a risk assessment and a layered cybersecurity defense plan.

As a consultant, I worked with my team leader, to develop an integrated defense strategy and prepare a risk management framework. The project required not only technical knowledge but also strong communication skills to effectively convey complex cybersecurity concepts to Boldi AG’s non-technical management team.


## Key Contributions and Tasks:

### 1. Explaining Integrated Defense:

- During a meeting with Boldi AG’s management, I explained the concept of layered integrated defense. This involves protecting the company's core assets, data, and systems through multiple layers of security measures.
- I emphasized the importance of not only protecting against deliberate attacks but also preparing for non-intentional risks such as natural disasters or human error.
- I outlined the common biases companies face, including “blind spots” in their defense mechanisms and the over-reliance on existing systems without regular checks.

### 2. Due Care vs. Due Diligence in Risk Management:

- I analyzed Boldi AG’s past approach to cybersecurity and distinguished between "due care" (taking basic security measures) and "due diligence" (proactively managing risks).
- Through this analysis, I identified that the company’s failure to monitor its offsite backup facility posed a significant risk. This gap in their defense resulted from a lack of due diligence, exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access.

### 3. Risk Mitigation Strategies:

- To help Boldi AG limit the impact of potential security breaches, I provided a set of actionable strategies known as Deter, Detect, Prevent, Avoid:
    - *Deter*: Implementing stronger physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
    - *Detect*: Utilizing monitoring tools to identify suspicious activity as early as possible.
    - *Prevent*: Installing firewalls and access control systems to block potential threats.
    - *Avoid*: Removing or relocating critical data from high-risk environments when necessary.

### 4. Risk Assessment Process:

- I played a key role in organizing and conducting interviews with Boldi AG staff to assess the company’s risk tolerance and gather information about their risk management processes. I tailored my interviews based on the audience:
   - Management: Focused on their attitude toward risk, how they accepted or mitigated risk, and their decision-making processes.
   - Engineers: Concentrated on daily operations, changes in systems, and security challenges they encountered.
- Using this information, I assessed the suitability of quantitative vs. qualitative risk assessments, recommending the qualitative approach due to the company’s complex and dynamic risk environment.

### 5. Network Segmentation & Firewall Configuration:

- I contributed to a workshop designed to educate Boldi AG’s IT team about the importance of network segmentation. This involves dividing the network into different zones (e.g., Admin, Server, Client zones) to contain potential threats and limit access to critical data.
- I explained how to configure firewalls using whitelisting (allowing only trusted entities) and blacklisting (blocking known malicious actors), helping the team better secure their network architecture.

## Skills Acquired:

- Risk management frameworks and due diligence analysis
- Information security best practices (e.g., layered defense, CIA Triad)
- Vulnerability scanning and mitigation strategies
- Network security, segmentation, and firewall configurations
- Presentation preparation and communication with non-technical audiences
